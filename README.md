# Iris (EDA)

## Project Title:
### Comparative Analysis of Machine Learnin Models on the Iris Dataset

## Description
###### Project Overview: 
The aim of this project is to provide hands-on experience to trainees in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks using the famous Iris dataset. 
##### The project involves two main tasks:
1. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and outlier detection on the dataset.
2. Supervised Learning: Building baseline models, comparing multiple algorithms, tuning the best-performing model, and evaluating it against an ensemble of algorithms.
###### Dataset: Iris Dataset
• The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length,sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable specifying the iris species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

• Dataset Link: Iris Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
###### Tasks and Mark Distribution:
#### 1. Data Preprocessing :

• Load the Iris dataset.

• Perform data exploration and visualization.

• Check for missing values and handle them if any.

• Split the dataset into features and target variables.

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Outlier Detection:

• Apply K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data.

• Visualize the clusters.

• Detect outliers using appropriate techniques such as isolation forest or DBSCAN.

• Evaluate the clustering results.

#### 3. Supervised Learning: Baseline Model :

• Choose an appropriate evaluation metric based on the problem (classification).

• Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

• Build a baseline model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) using default parameters.

• Evaluate the baseline model's performance.

#### 4. Model Comparison :

• Select 3-4 machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) suitable for the problem.

• Implement each algorithm and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.

• Compare the performance of algorithms based on evaluation metrics.

• Select the best-performing algorithm.

#### 5. Model Tuning and Ensemble :
• Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing algorithm using Grid Search or Random Search.

• Evaluate the tuned model's performance.

• Implement an ensemble of the top-performing algorithms and compare its performance with the tuned model.

#### 6. Documentation and Presentation :

• Provide a clear and concise report documenting the project process, including data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and conclusions.

• Prepare a presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the project.
